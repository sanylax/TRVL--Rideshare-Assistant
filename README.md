# TRVL-Rideshare Assistant - This is a chatbot that takes an origin and destination, and tells you whether it would be cheaper to take Uber or Lyft

The bot is available on Facebook Messenger but is only available to testers at this time. If you want to try out the bot, you can deploy it to Heroku using the button below.
We used API.AI for handling the front-end user interaction, and we wrote a Python Script which calls both Uber and Lyft APIs.

More info about Api.ai webhooks could be found here:
